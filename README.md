# Wifi-and-MCU-starting-template
Atwinc1500 and Atsam4s16b project starting template. 
This project is meant to be a starting point for projects using the atsam4s MCU with atwinc1500.  

The mla driver for the atwinc1500, provide by microchip, is used so that the MCU can be changed easily.  See https://microchipsupport.force.com/s/article/Porting-ATWINC1500-host-driver-to-another-vendor-MCU for instructions on how to use this driver.  All files with wf_ prefix are part of this driver

# Work in progress
There is still work and lots of cleanup to be done.
